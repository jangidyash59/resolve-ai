# Example Runs — ResolveAI

Three documented end-to-end resolutions demonstrating the system's ability to handle exception, conflict+escalation, and abstention scenarios.

---

## Run 1 — Exception Handled Correctly

**Scenario:** Customer wants to return opened swimwear (non-returnable category), but hasn't worn it outside.

**Input:**
```json
{
  "ticket_id": "TKT-005",
  "customer_name": "Ananya Singh",
  "customer_tier": "bronze",
  "ticket_text": "I bought a swimsuit last week but it does not fit. I have not removed the tags or worn it outside, just tried it on indoors. I would like to exchange it for a different size. However, I noticed your site says swimwear is non-returnable. I have not used it at all, this seems unfair.",
  "order_context": {
    "order_id": "ORD-2026-44890",
    "order_date": "2026-03-21",
    "delivery_date": "2026-03-25",
    "items": [{"name": "AquaFit One-Piece Swimsuit - Medium", "price": 1999.00}],
    "total_amount": 2199.00,
    "payment_method": "upi"
  }
}
```

**Agent Pipeline Output:**

| Agent | Result |
|---|---|
| Triage | `issue_type: return_request` · `priority: medium` · `requires_escalation: false` |
| Researcher | Retrieved `returns_refunds.md §4.2 Non-Returnable Items`, `returns_refunds.md §3.1 Return Eligibility` |
| Architect | Drafted response acknowledging the exception request, citing the non-returnable policy, and offering a size guide or store credit alternative |
| Compliance | **APPROVED** — all claims cited, no PII, no hallucinations |

**Customer Response (excerpt):**
> Dear Ananya, thank you for reaching out. We understand how frustrating it is when a size doesn't fit as expected. Our swimwear category is marked non-returnable once unsealed, in line with hygiene standards [returns_refunds.md — 4.2 Non-Returnable Items]. However, because the item was only tried on indoors with tags intact, we'd like to offer you a **one-time size exchange** as a goodwill gesture. Please contact us with your preferred size and we'll arrange a replacement shipment [returns_refunds.md — 3.1 Return Eligibility: Special Discretion].

## Run 2 — Conflict Handled with Escalation

**Scenario:** Customer reports fraudulent charges and potential account compromise — mandatory escalation trigger.

**Input:**
```json
{
  "ticket_id": "TKT-006",
  "customer_name": "Vikram Nair",
  "customer_tier": "bronze",
  "ticket_text": "I see two charges on my credit card — ₹28,999 and ₹17,999 — but I only placed one order for ₹28,999. I did NOT make the second purchase. Someone may have hacked my account. Please investigate immediately and refund the unauthorized charge.",
  "order_context": {
    "order_id": "ORD-2026-45901",
    "order_date": "2026-03-26",
    "items": [{"name": "Sony Wireless Noise-Canceling Headphones", "price": 24999.00}],
    "total_amount": 28999.00,
    "payment_method": "credit_card"
  }
}
```

**Agent Pipeline Output:**

| Compliance | **APPROVED** — escalation correctly flagged |

**Customer Response (excerpt):**
> Dear Vikram, we take reports of unauthorized charges extremely seriously. Your account has been flagged for an immediate security review [fraud_prevention.md — 3.2 Account Security].

## Run 3 — Correct Abstention ("Need More Info" / Not-in-Policy)

**Scenario:** Customer asks about paying with cryptocurrency — a payment method not covered in any policy document.

**Input:**
```json
{
  "ticket_id": "TKT-012",
  "customer_name": "Suresh Pillai",
  "customer_tier": "bronze",
  "ticket_text": "Can I pay with cryptocurrency for a gaming PC? Also, if I pay with crypto and need to return it later, how does the refund process work?",
  "order_context": null
}
```

**Agent Pipeline Output:**

| Agent | Result |
|---|---|
| Triage | `issue_type: payment_inquiry` · `priority: low` · `requires_escalation: false` |
| Researcher | Searched all payment policy documents — no results for cryptocurrency payments |
| Architect | Drafted honest response: cryptocurrency not a supported payment method, listed what IS supported, offered to help with available options |
| Compliance | **APPROVED** — correctly abstains from inventing policy, no hallucinated claims |

**Customer Response (excerpt):**
> Dear Suresh, thank you for your question. At this time, cryptocurrency is not a supported payment method on our platform [payment_policy.md — 2.1 Accepted Payment Methods]. We currently accept UPI, Credit/Debit Cards, Net Banking, and Cash on Delivery. If the item is eligible, EMI options are also available on select cards. We'd be happy to help you place your order using any of these methods!

**Citations:** `payment_policy.md — 2.1 Accepted Payment Methods`
